# Ambient-analizer

The ambient analyser system uses sensors, an Arduino controller, Python scripts in VScode and a MySQL database. The system's objective is to take data from the Arduino IDE and send it to a Python script to connect and upload the data to the SQL database. After that, another Python script creates the graphics, performs the data analysis and generates the PDF file to display in HTML.
